# Websites

### How do websites work (A simple overview)
  * When a user goes to a url, the client sends a `GET` request to a server the hosts the website
  * The server resonds with files, *first* with the html index file
  * The file is read by the client and will find that it may need more files like a stylesheet, an image, or a js file. 
  * These files and objects are sent from the server to the client
